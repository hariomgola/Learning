# Introduction
 - RxJx stands for Reactive extension for javascript.
 - Reactive programming ia an asynchronous programming paradign concerned with data stream and the propagation of change or changes.
 - RxJs is a library for reactive programming using observables that make it easier to compare asynchronous or call-back based code.
 - RxJs provided one code type, the Observable, satellite type(Observer, Scheduler, subject) and opertaors inspire by Arrays(map, filter, reduce, every etc) to allow handling asynchronous event ad collections.
  
# Observables
 - Its an data stream which is always changing.
 - RxJs introcuces Observables, a new push system for javaScript.
 - An Observables is a simple producer of multiple values, "Pushing" them tp Observers(Consumers).
 - Let's take an example of any e-commerce order journey
        orderStatus   -  undefined            -  cart is empty
        orderStatus   -  order addded         -  order is added into cart
        orderStatus   -  order placed         -  order is placed
        orderStatus   -  order received       -  order is received at vendor end
        orderStatus   -  order processed      -  order is processing to submit 
        orderStatus   -  order submitted      -  order is provided to delivery partner
        orderStatus   -  order delivered      -  order is delivered to customer
        orderStatus   -  order completed      -  order is final completed and status is closed
 - Here we can check the status at any moment to time to check the status of order.
  
# Subscriber
 - It will listen to the observer for data change or any update in same.
 - Simple with above example i can check whats the status of current order.
  
# Observables
 - Observables emits data over a peroid of time.
 - Observabees need to subscribed else it won't do anything on its own.
 - Observable has namely 3 methord for usecase.
      next 
      complete
      error
 - Angular uses observables extensively under the hood for routing, form and almost all features.
  
# Operator
 - RxJs library provided a lot of userful operators which help us write clean code and reduce lot of effort in writing custom logic.
 - Operator is a pure function.
      
# Pure Function
 - A pure function is a simple function which take the input and return the same input
        Sample input(Hari)   -> Sample output(Hari)    Pure function don't change anything
 - An simple opertaor take in observable as input and output will also be an Observables.
  
# Types of Operators
 - Creation
 - Mathamatics
 - Join
 - Transformation
 - Filtering
 - Utility
 - Conditional
 - Multicasting
 - Error Handling

const opertators = () => `
# of
  - of operator is used to create and observables for string, array and object.
  - When we have to pass a variable instead of a string we want observable we can use of operator
  
# from
  - from operator will create and object from an array.
  - It might be an array like object, a promise, an iterable object or an observable like object
  - Remeber it will take always array or array like operator. If string or number is passed for same. It will throw an error.
  
# from Event
  - Create and observable that emits event of a specific type coming fron the given target.
  - We can bind element and methord to make sure we get observable as output.
  - Angular - we can use viewChild, nativeElement as target elements and bind events
  
# Interval
 - Create an observable from the source observable only after a particulat time span has passed without another source emission.
     const number$ = interval(100);
     number$.subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     }); 
      
# debounceTime
 - Emits a notification from the source observable only after a particular time span has passed without another source emission.
     const number$ = interval(500);
     number$.pipe(debounceTime(100)).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });

# take
 - Emit only the first count value emitted by the source observable.
     const number$ = interval(500);
     number$.pipe(take(2), debounceTime(100)).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# takeWhile
 - Emits values emitted by the source observable so long as each value satisfies the given predicte, and the completes as soon as this prediction is not satisfied.
 - Simple takeWhile will check the condition and once satisfied it will execute it.
     const number$ = interval(500);
     number$
       .pipe(
         takeWhile((data) => {
           return data % 2 === 0 ? true : false;
         }),
         debounceTime(100)
       )
       .subscribe((data) => {
         console.log(' |> ', data);
       });
  
# takeLast
 - wait for the source to complete, Then emits the last N value from the source, as specified by the count arguments.
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
     number$.pipe(takeLast(2)).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# first
 - It will get the first value emitted by the observables.
 - If at any instance we want the first value of observable we user first operator
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
       number$.pipe(first()).subscribe((data) => {
         console.log(' |> ', data);
       });
  
# last
 - It will get the last value emitted by the observables
 - If at any instance we want the last value of observable we use last operator
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
     number$.pipe(last()).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# ElementAt
 - It will be used to get the particult value at inded when the value is emitted
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
     number$.pipe(elementAt(5)).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# filter
 - We used filter operator to filter out the data from observables.
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
     number$
       .pipe(
         filter((data) => {
           return data > 5;
         })
       )
       .subscribe((data) => {
         console.log(' |> ', data);
       });
  
# distinct
 - We use distinct when we want the distinct value from an observables
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8]);
     number$.pipe(distinct()).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# skip 
 - We use skip operator to skip the value.
 - Example i want to skip the first 5 value we can use the skip operator
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8]);
     number$.pipe(distinct(), skip(3)).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# count
 - If we want to get the count of value emitted by operator we use count operator
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8]);
     number$.pipe(distinct(), count()).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# max (works with numberical values)
 - max operator take all the input value and return the max value from an observable
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8]);
     number$.pipe(distinct(), max()).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
  
# min (works with numerical value)
 - min operator take all the input value and return the min value from an observable
     const number$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8]);
     number$.pipe(distinct(), min()).subscribe((data) => {
       console.log(' |> ', data);
     });
